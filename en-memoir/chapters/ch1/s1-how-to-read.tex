\s{How to read the book}

The best way to read this book is to just read it. Don't skip sections,
or look ahead, or anything like that. Just read it straight
through. It's also pretty important that you read the rest of this
chapter. I promise it's not too boring.

Do all of the exercises. There aren't that many. However, they are
pretty difficult. The exercises all have solutions, which are in
\cref{ex-solutions}.

The exercises are designed to make you think, and widen your perspective
on the topic at hand. They are not designed to be tedious. They are
difficult, but the good kind of difficult.

It would be perfectly okay to just do the exercises (all of them), and
then go back and read the text when you don't understand something.

There are two automatically generated versions of the book.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\rmfamily The version optimized for printing uses this font for text,
      and the other font for headers.} If you are reading the print version:
    yes, I understand the margins are ridiculous; it's for readability, though.
  \item {\sffamily The version optimized for reading on an electronic screen
      uses this font for text, and the other font for headers.}
\end{itemize}
