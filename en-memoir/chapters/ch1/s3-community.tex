\s{The community}

Despite the fact that I used ``I'' in the first part of the book, LYSA is
actually a community project, and many people participate in the writing of this
book.

If you want to talk to us, or to other math people, come see us in \code{\#lysa}
on Freenode. If you don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a client set up,
you can click on this URL on a computer, or type it into a web browser:
\btrurl{http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lysa}.

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the IRC
channel (\code{\#lysa} on FreeNode in case you forgot).

If you want to submit a correction, or have some issue, or want to add some
content, really anything having to do with the content of the book, you can
visit \link{https://github.com/learnyou/lysa}{our GitHub page}. We also have a
\link{http://learnyou.org}{website} and a
\link{https://lysa.reddit.com/}{community on Reddit}.

If you staunchly don't want to get involved with the community, but still want
to complain, you can of course use the \bugtracker\ or \emailme .
