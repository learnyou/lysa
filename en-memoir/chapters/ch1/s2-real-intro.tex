\s{Introduction (for real this time)}\label{real-intro}

This is a math book. Well, duh. Why did I write it?

In my experience, most math (and science) books nowadays seem to value keeping
an academic tone over ensuring that the reader understands the material, and ---
more importantly --- enjoys reading the book.

I take the opposite approach. I want to create a book that is fun to read and
easy to understand, while eschewing the practice of making myself look good.

In high school, and even in college, I noticed that subjects were taught with
pragmatism in mind: here's what you need to learn to have a job doing X.  It
completely zaps the intellectual curiosity of the students. I think that's a
shame. I hope reading this book will rekindle your intellectual curiosity.

The inspiration for this book is \emph{Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!} by
Miran Lipova\v{c}a, which is a beginner's guide to the Haskell programming
language.
