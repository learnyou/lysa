\s{Conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations}

I sort of hinted at these in the last section.

We've already seen logical negation:

\begin{definition}[Logical negation]
    \label{def:lnot}
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot X = X \to \bot
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
What are the other two?

\begin{definition}[Conjunction]
    \label{def:conjunction}
    This is usually called ``logical-and''. Basically, for

    \begin{equation}
        A \tand B 
    \end{equation}

    to be ``true'' (or $\top$), then both $A$ and $B$ have to be $\top$.
    
    To be more precise, $A \tand B$ is a type, and the proof of that type, which
    I'll call $\join$, is as follows:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:join}
        \join : A \to B \to A \tand B
    \end{equation}

    You'll often see the symbol $\land$ used in place of writing out ``and''.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Disjunction]
    \label{def:disjunction}
    A disjunction is somewhat equivalent to saying ``or''. It's also called
    ``logical-or''.

    Like logical-and, logical-or is a type constructor:

    \begin{equation}
        A \tor B : \Type
    \end{equation}

    The symbol for logical-or is $\lor$. However, in most cases, it's clearer
    and easier to type out the word ``or''.

    Logical disjunction has two proofs:

    \begin{eqnarray}
        \branchleft & : & A \to A \tor B \\
        \branchright & : & B \to A \tor B \\
    \end{eqnarray}

    Basically, if you have a proof of either one of the propositions, you have a
    proof of the disjunction.

    The proofs are not mutually exclusive. That is, if you have a proof of $A$,
    as well as a proof of $B$, then $A \tor B$ still holds.
\end{definition}
