The answer is to try to prove each law. They can all be proved using very simple
logic.

Let's get going! Just for the hell of it, let's work in reverse order.

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's second law, part 2]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot P \tand \lnot Q \implies \lnot\parens{P \tor Q}
    \end{equation}

    Well, let's think about this. We are trying to prove $\lnot\parens{P \tor
      Q}$ assuming $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$. My favorite way to prove things is
    by putting stuff into a table such as this:

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \lnot P \\
        b & : & \lnot Q \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal} & : & \lnot \parens{P \tor Q} \\
    \end{rclmath}

    The given proofs are above the line, and the goal is below the line. $a :
    \lnot P$ should be read as ``$a$ is a proof of $\lnot P$''.

    \begin{asidebox}
        Formal proofs start with the word ``proof'' italicized, and then a silly
        box at the end. I'm not sure about the origins of the white box. The
        \LaTeX command to add the box is \code{\textbackslash qed}. QED stands
        for ``quod erat demonstrandum'' which is fancy math-latin-speak for
        ``end of demonstration'', or in this case ``end of proof''. In this
        book, the white box is on the lower right corner of the proof, and has a
        cross inside, and no top line: \qed.
    \end{asidebox}

    Anyway, let's get started!

    \begin{proof}
        Remember, for all $X$,

        \begin{equation}
            \lnot X = X \to \bot
        \end{equation}

        Thus, we can substitute $\lnot$-whatever with whatever-implies-bottom.

        \begin{rclmath}
            a & : & P \implies \bot \\
            b & : & Q \implies \bot \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        \end{rclmath}

        Well, now, the dynamics have shifted: we can now move $P \lor Q$ above the
        line, because we are now trying to prove $\bot$ assuming $a$, and $b$, along
        with $P \lor Q$. Therefore:

        \begin{rclmath}
            a & : & P \implies \bot \\
            b & : & Q \implies \bot \\
            c & : & P \tor Q \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{rclmath}

        When we have a logical-or in one of the assumptions (the stuff we know,
        i.e. above the line), then we have to consider both branches.

        We know that one of the following is correct:

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $P$ and $Q$ both hold
        \item $P$ holds, but $Q$ doesn't
        \item $Q$ holds, but $P$ doesn't
        \end{enumerate}

        Let's consider each situation

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $P$ and $Q$ both hold
            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & P \implies \bot \\
                b & : & Q \implies \bot \\
                c_1 & : & P \\
                d_1 & : & Q \\
                \eva{a}{c_1} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            \qed
          \item $P$ holds, but $Q$ doesn't
            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & P \implies \bot \\
                c_2 & : & P \\
                \eva{a}{c_2} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            \qed
          \item $Q$ holds, but $P$ doesn't
            \begin{rclmath}
                b & : & Q \implies \bot \\
                c_3 & : & Q \\
                \eva{b}{c_3} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            \qed
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's second law, part 1]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tor Q} \implies \lnot P \tand \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    \answergraph{another-theorem-gimped.png}

    Let's do the unfolding and what not. I did it in the last couple of proofs,
    so I won't bother explaining it here. Well, it would probably be quicker to
    just explain what I'm doing than to explain that explaining my actions would
    take longer than\dots gah, recursion!

    Anyway:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{
          \parens{P \tor Q}
          \implies \bot
        }
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{P \implies \bot}
          \tand
          \parens{Q \implies \bot}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Which, in silly 4\textsuperscript{th}-grader chalkboard form:

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal} & : & \parens{P \implies \bot} \tand \parens{Q \implies \bot} \\
    \end{rclmath}

    \begin{proof}
        So, we'll have to do the same thing as before, ish. Since we have a
        $\land$ in the goal, we have to prove both branches of it. So, let's get
        started.

        \begin{description}
          \item[Left branch] First, the left branch

            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & P \implies \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            We can proceed from here, moving anything before the last $\implies$
            symbol above the line (because we are proving the last thing
            assuming the previous things).

            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                b & : & P \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Well, if you'll remember, a proof of $P$ is a valid proof of
            $P \lor Q$. Therefore:

            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                b & : & P \\
                \eva{a}{\eva{\branchleft}{b}} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Yay! \qed
          \item[Right branch] Yay, now the right branch

            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchright & : & Q \implies \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Well, now we can move the $Q$ up:
        
            \begin{rclmath}
                a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                b_{\branchright} & : & Q \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchright & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Then apply $b$: to $a$ to get:

            \begin{rclmath}
                a                              & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
                b                              & : & Q \\
                \eva{a}{\eva{\branchright}{b}} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}_\branchright       & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Yay! Theroem proved! \qed
        \end{description}
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Alright, let's get this out of the way

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's first law, part 2]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot P \tor \lnot Q \to \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} 
    \end{equation}

    Which, in proof-friendly form:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{
          \parens{P \to \bot}
          \tor
          \parens{Q \to \bot}
        }
        \to
        \parens{P \tand Q} 
        \to
        \bot
    \end{equation}

    \begin{proof}
        Let's put this in fourth-grader form:

        \begin{rclmath}
            a           & : & \parens{P \implies \bot} \tor \parens{Q \implies \bot} \\
            b           & : & P \tand Q \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{rclmath}

        Okay, well, a rule that I haven't mentioned yet is, if you have
        $P \land Q$ as an assumption, you can split that into two
        assumptions. You have a proof that both $P$ and $Q$ hold. Thus, you can
        split that into a proof that $P$ holds and a proof that $Q$ holds.

        \begin{rclmath}
            a           & : & \parens{P \implies \bot} \tor \parens{Q \implies \bot} \\
            b           & : & P \\
            c           & : & Q \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{rclmath}

        Hmm. Okay, well, remember, if we have a $\lor$ as one of the
        assumptions, we have to consider both branches of it. So....

        \begin{description}
          \item[Left branch of $a$] This is if $P \implies \bot$ holds, but not
            the other.
            
            \begin{rclmath}
                a_\branchleft          & : & P \implies \bot \\
                b                      & : & P \\
                c                      & : & Q \\
                \eva{a_\branchleft}{b} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}   & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Yay!! \qed
          \item[Right branch of $a$] This is if $Q \implies \bot$ holds, but not
            the other.
            
            \begin{rclmath}
                a_\branchright          & : & Q \implies \bot \\
                b                       & : & P \\
                c                       & : & Q \\
                \eva{a_\branchright}{c} & : & \bot \\
                \hline \\
                \text{goal}   & : & \bot \\
            \end{rclmath}

            Yay!! 
        \end{description}
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

That was exhausting. Go take a break, you've earned it. I'll put in a page break,
just for you. \newpage
