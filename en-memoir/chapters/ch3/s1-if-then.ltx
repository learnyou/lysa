\s{If A then B; A, therefore B.}

So, let's say we want to prove that some proposition $a$ implies another
proposition $b$. Well, then, all we have to do is find a function with type

\begin{equation}
    a \implies b
\end{equation}

When dealing with normal non-proofy functions, you can think of the symbol
$\implies$ as saying ``to''. With proofs, it's more helpful to think of the
symbol as ``implies''.

Occasionally, you'll also see the backwards arrow: $\impliedby$, which means
``implied by'', and $\iff$, which means ``if (and only if)''.

The expression $a \iff b$ is just shorthand for

\begin{alignmath}{rc}
    a \implies b & \text{and} \\
    a \impliedby b &
\end{alignmath}

\begin{remark}[Consequence of the Curry-Howard correspondence]
    A value of type $a$, where $a$ is a proposition, is a proof of the
    proposition $a$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Consequence of the Curry-Howard correspondence]
    A function with type $a \implies b$ is a proof that $a$ implies $b$.

    That is, if $a$, then $b$.
\end{remark}

\ss{Disproving stuff}

So, how do we disprove something? Well, again, that's not our goal. We instead
want to prove that something isn't provable. That sounds weird, doesn't it?

A staple of logic is called \term{reductio ad absurdum}. It's Latin for
``reduction to the absurd''. Given a proposition $A$, if you can prove that $A$
implies something unprovable, then $A$ is obviously unprovable.

Well, in math, we so happen to have a value that is unprovable. That value is
bottom: $\bot$. Rather, $\bot$ is what's called the ``empty type''. Namely,
there is no value $x$ such that $x : \bot$.

I'm going to introduce you to a new symbol: $\exists$. It means ``there
exists''. The dual symbol is $\notexists$ which means ``there does not
exist''. The $\exists$ going with the term ``exists'' shouldn't be too hard to
remember.

The reason I bring that up now is, it's easy to define $\bot$ using $\exists$:

\begin{equation}
    \notexists x \mid x : \bot
\end{equation}

Remember, the pipe should be read as ``such that''. There does not exist $x$
such that $x : \bot$. Likewise, if we have some proof

\begin{equation}
    f = A \implies \bot
\end{equation}

Then $A$ is a false proposition, because it implies a proof of the unprovable.

Because mathematicians like to be lazy, we don't like to write out $A \implies
\bot$ every time. For this reason, we have the $\lnot$ Symbol

\begin{definition}[Unprovability]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot A = A \implies \bot
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\ss{Watch yourself!}

A common mistake is to say ``Well, if $A$ happens, then $B$ will happen. If I
know that $B$ happened, then I can reasonably conclude that $A$ happened at some
point in the past.'' Let's go through an example to show why this doesn't quite
work.

If someone is decapitated, then they are dead, at least within a few seconds.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decapdead}
    \text{Decapitated} \implies \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

\answergraph{images/alas-poor-yorick-5.png}

However, if someone is dead, it doesn't necessarily mean they were
decapitated. They could have been shot, stabbed, had a heart attack, been hit by
a bus; there are endless possibilities. Thus,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \text{Decapitated} \notimpliedby \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

\ss{The contraposition}

If someone is alive (i.e. \xtb{not} dead), then they obviously weren't
decapitated. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \lnot\text{Decapitated}\impliedby\lnot\text{Dead}
\end{equation}

This is a fundamental rule of logic, called the \term{contraposition} (or,
marginally more pretentiously, \term{modus tollens}). We can actually prove it
fairly easily.

\begin{lemma}[Contraposition]
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:contraposition}
        \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A}
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{rclmath}
        f&:& \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A} \\
        f&:& \parens{A \implies B} \implies \lnot B \implies \lnot A \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Remember that, for all propositions $X$,

    \begin{equation}
        \lnot X = X \implies \bot
    \end{equation}

    If we make this substitution on the last two types:

    \begin{rclmath}
        \lnot B & = & B \implies \bot \\
        \lnot A & = & A \implies \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Then, the type of $f$ becomes:

    \begin{rclmath}
        f & : & \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{B \implies \bot} \implies \parens{A \implies \bot} \\
        f & : & \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{B \implies \bot} \implies A \implies \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Now the proof is as simple as composing the first and second functions:

    \begin{equation}
        \eva{f}{p,q} = q \circ p
    \end{equation}

    In a marginally less confusing form:

    \begin{equation}
        \eva{f}{p,q,r} = \eva{q}{\eva{p}{r}}
    \end{equation}

\end{proof}

Alright, that was pretty hard! I can almost guarantee you didn't understand that
the first time. It's an entirely new concept!

Go take a coffee break, take a walk, or something of the like, come back in an
hour, and read over the explanation again. I bet it'll be a lot easier to
understand the second time around.

I'm even going to manually insert a page break so you aren't as tempted to keep
going.

\ss{Examples}

Here are some examples of proving stuff!

\begin{example}
    \label{expl:doubneg1}
    Let's prove that

    \begin{equation}
        A \implies \lnot \parens{\lnot A}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{proof}
        Substitute $\lnot x \Longrightarrow x \to \bot$.

        \begin{alignedmath}
            A \implies \lnot \parens{A \to \bot} \\
            A \implies \parens{\parens{A \implies \bot} \implies \bot} \\
            A \implies \parens{A \implies \bot} \implies \bot \\
        \end{alignedmath}

        The proof of this is then

        \begin{equation}
            \fn{x,f}{\eva{f}{x}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{proof}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    If you know that $A \implies B$ and that $B \implies C$, then
    $A \implies C$.

    \begin{proof}
        The proof will be of this type:

        \begin{equation}
            f : \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{B \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}
        \end{equation}

        Remember that $X \implies Y \implies Z \implies \dots$ is just shorthand
        for $X \to \parens{Y \to \parens{Z \to \dots}}$.

        Thus, we can take that last pair of parentheses off:

        \begin{equation}
            f : \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{B \implies C} \implies A \implies C
        \end{equation}

        Here's a solution

        \begin{equation}
            \eva{f}{g,h,x} = \eva{h}{\eva{g}{x}}
        \end{equation}

        Or, in $\eta$-reduced form:

        \begin{equation}
            \eva{f}{g,h} = h \of g
        \end{equation}
        
    \end{proof}
\end{example}
