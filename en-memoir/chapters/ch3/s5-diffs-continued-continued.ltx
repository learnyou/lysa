Alright, that section was getting pretty long! You have probably guessed by now,
but the first part of the first De Morgan law is the one that isn't true in
intuitionistic logic. Why?

Well... I can't really think of a good intuitive reason. You can prove that De
Morgan's first law only holds if you assume these two axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The law of excluded middle (LEM). That is,

    \begin{equation}
        \fall P \comma P \tor \lnot P
    \end{equation}

  \item Double negation

    \begin{equation}
        \fall P \comma P \iff \lnot \lnot P
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

But I don't even understand the proof. Until I fully understand it, I can't
really justify excluding it. Many mathematicians just use classical logic
because it's more convenient.
