# Outline

Here's my (pharpend) basic outline for the book. It's extremely rough at this
point and will probably be gutted and slaughtered in its entirety.

* Chapter 1, Introduction
* Chapter 2, functions and types
    + Define types
    + Define functions
        * Comprehension notation
        * Domain & codomain
        * Functions that output types
        * Functions that output other functions
        * Currying
        * Injective functions and surjective functions
        * Inverting functions
    + Useful functions
        * id
        * (.)
        * flip

* Chapter 3, Propositions
    + Proofs are functions
    + Types are propositions
    + The life and times of Haskell Brooks Curry
        
* Chapter 4, Special sets
    + Magmas
    + Semigroups
    + Categories
    + Monoids
    + Groups
    + Rings
    + Fields

* Chapter 5, fancy functions
    + Homomorphisms
    + Isomorphisms
    + Endomorphisms

* Chapter 6, monomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines

* Chapter 7, polynomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines
    + Quadratic formula

Let us make this our goal for now, then we will move on.

* Chapter 8, exponential functions
* Chapter 9, logarithms
* Chapter 10, trig functions

This is a good segue to talk about Complex numbers

* Chapter 11, complex and imaginary numbers
* Chapter 12, Complex functions
* Chapter 13, Complex algorithms

Good segue to talk about the concept of dimensions

* Chapter 14, Dimensions
* Chapter 15, Parametric functions
* Chapter 16, Complex parametric functions
* Chapter 17, functions that go from F^n to F, where F is a field.
* Chapter 18, functions that go from F to F^n, where F is a field.
* Chapter 19, functions that go from F^n to F^m, where F is a field.
                                                         
We'll next want to approach *systems* of equations. first\ matrices

* Chapter 20, Matrices
    + Matrix addition, multiplication, etc
    + Matrices as linear functions

* Chapter 21, Systems of equations
    + What is a system of equations
    + using matrices to solve for them

* Chapter 22, Vector spaces

... Basically go through linear algebra

* Chapter 35, calculus

... Go through calculus and differential equations

<!-- This fixes #1 -->

* Chapter 52, Statistics

* Appendix B - boring stuff
    + Introduction of the primary authors (Peter Harpending, Randy Brown).
    + Book license
    + How to contribute
