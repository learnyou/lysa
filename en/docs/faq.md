# Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Why is LYSA licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, and not the
    Creative Commons ShareAlike license?**

    The FDL is designed specifically for textbooks and manuals, whereas the
    CC-SA license is designed for any creative work. Thus, the wording in the
    FDL, is much more specific to our situation, and therefore less
    ambiguous. 

    For instance, the FDL requires that the document be made available in source
    form. This is hugely important for a textbook, because otherwise you
    wouldn't be able to edit it. The CC-SA license has no such requirement.

2.  **Do you guys have a blog or something?**

    Yes. http://learnyou.org . I have yet to post anything there. When I have
    something to post, it will go there, though. If you want a forum-type thing,
    you probably want to visit our subreddit: https://lysa.reddit.com/

3.  **I found an error, what do I do?**

    If you know how to fix it, it would be best if you would clone the
    git repo, fix the issue, and then send a merge request. If you don't
    want to do this, the next best thing would be to
    [open a bug](https://github.com/lysa/issues/new).

    Unfortunately, opening a bug requires a GitHub account. GitHub
    accounts are gratis. If you don't want to make a GitHub account for
    whatever reason, you can email `peter@harpending.org` with the
    issue.

4.  **Why is LYSA only available as a PDF? Can I get it in some other format?**

    In theory, yes. However, the only tool that can do this is
    [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Unfortunately, Pandoc is really
    buggy, so we can't convert it yet.

5.  **How do I get in touch with you?**

    You could email me, `peter@harpending.org`. We have an IRC channel, `#lysa`
    on FreeNode. If you want a forum-type experience, we have a
    [subreddit](https://lysa.reddit.com/).
