\s{Set construction}

Let's invent a set.

\begin{equation}
    Q \ce \mset{7, 7, 9, 5, 10, 1, 6, 6, 2, 10}
\end{equation}

There we go. Remember, order and multiplicity don't matter. But, for the sake of
clarity, let's put the elements in order, and deduplicate them.

\begin{equation}
    Q \ce \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}
\end{equation}

Yay! You may have noticed that I slipped in the word \term{element} into the
previous sentence. Objects in the set are called \term{elements}. 

It's too strenuous on our weak mathematical hands to write ``$10$ is an element
of $Q$'', so instead we have the symbol $\in$. $\in$ is a very terrible attempt
at drawing an E. If you can't remember what $\in$ is, think ``{$\in$}lement
of''.

Let's look at some examples:

\begin{equation}
    Q \ce \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    6 \in Q
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    7 \in Q
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    11 \notin Q
\end{equation}

What if we want to say ``both $6$ and $2$ are elements of $Q$'', in one
expression? We could write it out like:

\begin{equation}
    \parens{6 \in Q} \land \parens{2 \in Q}
\end{equation}

But that's too cumbersome, so instead we'll write 

\begin{equation}
    2, 6 \in Q
\end{equation}

\pg{But won't that get confusing?}

Only if we put parentheses or braces around $2$ or $6$.

\begin{equation}
    \mset{2, 6} \in Q
\end{equation}

That's confusing, don't do that (yet).

\pg{The null set}

The null set is the simplest set, as it contains no elements. ``Null set'' takes
too long to write, so we use $\emptyset$ instead.

\begin{equation}
    \nil \ce \mset{}
\end{equation}

We can even have sets of other sets:

\begin{equation}
    \mset{\mset{1,2,3},\mset{4,5,6},\mset{3,1,6}}
\end{equation}

\sss{Notation and construction of infinite sets}

By now, you're hopefully familiar with the simple bracket notation for finite
sets:

\begin{equation}
    A \ce \mset{4,5,6,2,56,7573,22,20}
\end{equation}

It's not very hard. Next, we have the ``extrapolation notation'' of infinite
sets:

% \newcommand{\cdots}{\cdot\cdot\cdot}

\begin{rclmath}
    \N & \ce & \mset{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,\cdots} \\
    \Z & \ce & \mset{\cdots,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4, \cdots} \\
\end{rclmath}

That notation is okay when there is a very obvious pattern. What about this:

\begin{equation}
    \Q \ce \mset{
        \frac{0}{1}
      , \frac{1}{1}
      , \frac{1}{-1}
      , \frac{0}{-1}
      , \frac{-1}{-1}
      , \frac{-1}{1}
      , \frac{-1}{2}
      , \frac{0}{2}
      , \frac{1}{2}
      , \frac{2}{2}
      , \frac{2}{1}
      , \frac{2}{-1}
      , \frac{2}{-2}
      , \frac{1}{-2}
      , \cdots
    }
\end{equation}

The pattern is not very obvious, and it requires a ton of repetition. For
instance

\begin{equation}
      \frac{0}{1}
    = \frac{0}{-1}
    = \frac{0}{2}
    = \frac{0}{-2}
\end{equation}

Yet, each of those is represented as a unique element in $\Q$. A much better
notation would be:

\begin{equation}
    \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \semic x,y \in \Z \land y \neq 0}
\end{equation}

Okay, how do you read that?

\begin{iquote}
    \begin{equation}
        \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \semic x,y \in \Z \land y \neq 0}
    \end{equation}

    $\Q$ is the set of all fractions $x$ over $y$, such that $x$ and $y$ are
    both in $\Z$, and $y$ is not equal to $0$.
\end{iquote}

That notation is sort of hairy, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly.

\pg{Well, don't get too used to it}

There's a big problem with that notation:

Let's consider the set of all sets, $S$. (This set doesn't actually exist, but
I'm going to pretend that it does)

\begin{equation}
    S = \mset{x \semic \text{\(x\) is a set}}
\end{equation}

That's not really problematic. Except for the fact that

\begin{equation}
    S \in S
\end{equation}

Even that: it's a little weird, but it's acceptable. There exists a set that is
an element of itself.

Let's consider another set:

\begin{iquote}
    \begin{equation}
        A \ce \mset{x \semic x \in S \land x \notin x}
    \end{equation}

    $A$ is the set of all objects $x$ such that $x$ is a set, and $x$ is not an
    element of itself.
\end{iquote}

Um, okay. That's kind of weird, but okay.

\begin{iquote}
    Is $A \in A$?
\end{iquote}

Wait, what? Well, obviously not. $A$ is the set of all sets $x$ such that $x$ is
an element of itself. So if $A \in A$, then it would by definition be excluded
from the set.

Phew! So, the conclusion is that $A \notin A$.

But wait! $A$ is the set of all sets $x$ such that $x \notin x$. So, if
$A \notin A$, then $A \in A$!

We've happened upon a paradox known as \term{Russell's paradox}, where

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:russel-paradox}
    A \in A \iff A \notin A
\end{equation}

The conclusion to draw from this is that $A$ is not a set. Okay, that's not too
bad.

But, wait, look how I defined $A$:

\begin{equation}
    A \ce \mset{x \semic x \in S \land x \notin x}
\end{equation}

I defined it using that weird notation where I describe what each element looks
like, and then list some conditions about the element.

So, just because something can be described using that notation doesn't mean
it's a set. So, you have to be careful.

There's an easy way to avoid Russell's paradox: just make all of the individual
element be an element of another set:

So, instead of writing

\begin{equation}
    \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \semic x,y \in \Z \land y \neq 0}
\end{equation}

Instead, write

\begin{equation}
    \Q \ce \mset{\frac{x}{y} \in \R \semic x,y \in \Z \land y \neq 0}
\end{equation}

That's okay.

The acute reader is probably noting that, the way I defined $A$ was

\begin{equation}
    A \ce \mset{x \semic x \in S \land x \notin x}
\end{equation}

\xtb{So, because $S$ is a set, and every element of $A$ is in $S$, doesn't that
  mean that your thing is wrong?}

Well, no, because, if you'll remember, the set of all sets doesn't actually
exist.

\xtb{I'm confused}

So am I, and I'm writing this stuff. Go take a coffee break, and come back in an
hour.

\ss{Subsets and Supersets}

Remember when I said $\mset{2, 6} \in Q$, and we were really confused? In case
you don't remember, $Q = \mset{1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}$. $\mset{2,6}$ is obviously
not an element of $Q$. However, $\mset{2, 6}$ is \xti{in} $Q$ but it's not an
element. It's weird. How do we express this notion?

The answer is with \term{subsets}. ``sub'' means ``smaller'', so a ``subset''
would be a ``smaller set''. $A$ is a subset of $B$ is all of the elements in $A$
are also in $B$. The notation is $A \subeq B$. Some people will read that as
``$A$ is contained in $B$''.

Referring to the previous example,

\[ \mset{2,6} \subeq Q \]

\pg{Wait, what is with the little line under the round half circley thing?}

So, actually, there are two types of subsets - \term{proper} and
\term{improper}. $A \subeq B$ is for improper subsets. $A \subof B$ is for
proper subsets. What's the difference, then?

$A \subeq B$ allows for the possibility that $A = B$. $A \subof B$ means that
$B$ is \xti{strictly larger} than $A$; there are some elements in $B$ that are
not in $A$.

\label{exists}
I've already defined $\forall$ in \cref{forall}. I'm now going to add another
symbol, $\exists$, which means ``exists''. I mention $\forall$, because
$\exists$ is used in the same context.

Anyway, back to business. I use $\subeq$ for improper subsets, and $\subof$ for
proper subsets. However, some people will use $\subof$ for improper subsets, and
something like $\subsetneq$ or $\subsetneqq$ for proper subsets. You have to
look out.

Here's something cool: $\nil$ has no elements, so it's a subset of every set.

\[ \nil \subeq A \sfall A \]

I'm sure you can figure this out, two sets are equal iff they have the same
elements. $A \subeq B$ means that $B$ has all of the elements that $A$ has.
$A \supeq B$ would mean that $A$ has all of the elements of $B$. So if both of
those are true, then $A = B$. That is:

\[ A = B \iff A \subeq B \land A \supeq B \]

So, what did we learn?

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are unordered collections with no multiplicity, called \term{sets}.
\item There are ordered collections with multiplicity, called \term{vectors}.
\item Given an object $o$ and a set $A$, you can ask $o \Qin A$.
\item You can pull smaller sets out of a set (I'll show you the mechanics
  below). The way to express that a set is ``embedded'' in another set, without
  being an element is with \term{subsets}. $A \Qsubeq B$ would be asking ``are
  all of the elements in $A$ also in $B$?''. (The converse doesn't necessarily
  have to be true).
\item There's a pretty easy set which has no elements, called $\nil$. An
  interesting property of $\nil$ is that it is a subset of all other sets.
\item Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements.
\end{enumerate}
