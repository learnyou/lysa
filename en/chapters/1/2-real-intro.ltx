\s{Introduction (for real this time)}\label{real-intro}

This is a math book. Well, duh. Why did I write it?

Most math (and science) books nowadays seem to value keeping an academic
tone over ensuring that the reader understands the material, and ---
more importantly --- enjoys reading the book.

I take the opposite approach. I want to create a book that is fun to
read and easy to understand, while eschewing the practice of making
myself look good.

In high school, and even in college, I noticed that subjects were taught
with pragmatism in mind: here's what you need to learn to have a job
doing X.  It completely zaps the intellectual curiosity of the
students. I think that's a shame. I hope reading this book will rekindle
your intellectual curiosity.

The inspiration for this book is \href{http://learnyouahaskell.com/}{{\emph
    Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!}, by Miran Lipovaƒça}, which is a
beginner's guide to the Haskell programming language.
