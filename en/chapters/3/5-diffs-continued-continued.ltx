Alright, that section was getting pretty long! You have probably guessed by now,
but the first part of the first De Morgan law is the one that isn't true in
intuitionistic logic. Why?

Well... I can't really think of a good intuitive reason. You can prove that De
Morgan's first law only holds if you assume these two axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The law of excluded middle (LEM). That is,

    \begin{equation}
        \fall P \comma P \tor \lnot P
    \end{equation}

  \item Double negation

    \begin{equation}
        \fall P \comma P \iff \lnot \lnot P
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

If you'll remember, those are the two axioms that separate intuitionistic logic
from classical logic. The proof is incredibly long and awful. I've included it
in \cref{proof-de-morgan-1-1} if you really want to read it. I don't think
you'll have a lot of fun with it.

So, where do we go from here? There are a lot of fun areas of math. One of my
favorites, and one that's arguably incredibly useful, is number theory. Number
theory is also good because it will give you a good preparation for the other
areas in math.

Number theory has a couple of needed prerequisites, namely linear algebra, which
I'll happily go over. Number theory is sufficiently abstract to be interesting
and insightful, but nonetheless down-to-earth so that you might actually have
something useful at the end of all this.
