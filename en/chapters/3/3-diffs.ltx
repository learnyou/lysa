\s{Differences between intuitionistic logic and classical logic}

If you'll remember,

\begin{description}
  \item[classical logic] is where things are true or false.
  \item[intuitionistic logic] is where things are provable or not provable.
\end{description}

It seems like a subtle difference, but there are some rather annoying
consequences, which I'll go through in this section.

\ss{Your English teacher lied to you}

In classical logic, a well-known rule is the double-negative:

\begin{textmath}
    For all $X$,

    \begin{equation}
        X \iff \lnot \parens{\lnot X}
    \end{equation}
\end{textmath}

This isn't true in intuitionist logic. Well, one half of it is true. Namely:

\begin{definition}[Double negation, right]
    For all $X$,

    \begin{equation}
        X \implies \lnot \parens{\lnot X}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

I proved this in \cref{expl:doubneg1}.

The other half can't be proven, though

\begin{textmath}
    For all $X$,

    \begin{equation}
        X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X}
    \end{equation}
\end{textmath}

Let's try to prove that:

\begin{proof}[Double negation, left]
    For all $x$

    \begin{alignmath}{cl}
          & X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X} \\
        = & \lnot \parens{\lnot X} \implies X \\
        = & \lnot \parens{X \implies \bot} \implies X \\
        = & \parens{\parens{X \implies \bot} \implies \bot} \implies X \\
    \end{alignmath}

    We can't Curry the type, because the operators are left-associative. It's
    not provable.
\end{proof}

\pg{Forall}

I keep having to write ``For all $x$''. Conveniently, mathematicians have a
symbol for this: $\forall$. In text, it's clearer and easier to type out ``for
all''. However, a lot of people will use the $\forall$ symbol when writing
things by hand.

\sss{Negating foralls}

Remember, this is not provable:

\begin{equation}
    \fall X \semic X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X}
\end{equation}

To the untrained eye, this would then mean:

\begin{alignmath}{cl}
      & \lnot\parens{\fall X \semic X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X}} \\
    = & \fall X \semic X \notimpliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X} \\
\end{alignmath}

\xtb{But that's not the case!} There are certainly some cases where
$X \iff \lnot\lnot X$. But, there are also many cases where that doesn't
hold. So, you can't say that either version holds for all cases.

Instead, you just take off the $\fall$

\begin{textmath}
    For some $X$:

    \begin{equation}
        X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X} 
    \end{equation}
\end{textmath}

Likewise, 

\begin{textmath}
    For some $X$:

    \begin{equation}
        X \notimpliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X} 
    \end{equation}
\end{textmath}

The thing to take away from all this is, double negation doesn't always hold in
intuitionist logic.

\ss{The law of excluded middle}

You might be asking ``well, since we can't prove left-double-negation, doesn't
that mean that left-double-negation would imply $\bot$?''.

You're probably not asking that, because that sounds like complete nonsense.

Since we can't prove

\begin{equation}
    \fall X \semic X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X}
\end{equation}

Wouldn't that therefore mean that

\begin{equation}
    \fall X \semic \parens{X \impliedby \lnot \parens{\lnot X}} \implies \bot
\end{equation}

Well, no. You would be making another assumption from classical logic, called
\term{the law of excluded middle}, or \term{decidability}. That is:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lem}
    \fall X \semic X \tor \lnot X
\end{equation}

where $X$ is a proposition.

Basically, given some statement $X$,

\begin{description}
  \item[In classical logic] you can always \term{decide} whether or not $X$ is
    true.
  \item[In intuitionistic logic] that's not the case. There are values of $X$
    that are \term{undecideable}.
\end{description}

Remember the liar's paradox:

\begin{textmath}
    This statement is false.
\end{textmath}

That statement cannot be said to be true or false. It's \term{undecidable}.

Remember, to negate a statement starting with ``for all'', you just need to find a
case where the statement doesn't hold. In the case of the decidability law, I've
just found a case where the decidability law doesn't hold, so therefore it can't
hold for all propositions.

\ss{De Morgan's laws}

The undecidability law and the lack of left-double-negation are really the core
things you need to worry about with intuitionist logic. The next thing to look
out for are De Morgan's laws.

\begin{definition}[De Morgan's first law]
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:demorgan1}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \iff \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    You can think of this like this:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item I told you that
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I went to the park, and
          \item I went to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}
      \item If you can prove either
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I didn't go to the park, or
          \item I didn't go to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}

        then I lied to you.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[De Morgan's second law]
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:demorgan2}
        \lnot\parens{P \tor Q} \iff \lnot P \tand \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    This is the dual of the first law

    \begin{itemize}
      \item I told you that
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I went to the park, or
          \item I went to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}

      \item If you can prove that
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I didn't go to the park, and
          \item I didn't go to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}

        then I lied to you
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Remember that each of those laws is really two laws. For instance, the first law
can be stated as:

\begin{textmath}
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \implies \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    and

    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \impliedby \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}
\end{textmath}

I ``proved'', intuitively, the first branch of each law. Let's look at the
second branch of each law.

\begin{remark}[De Morgan's first law, part 2]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \impliedby \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item If I tell you
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I didn't go to the grocery store, or
          \item I didn't go to the park
        \end{enumerate}

      \item If you can prove
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I went to the grocery store, and
          \item I went to the park
        \end{enumerate}

        then I lied to you
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[De Morgan's second law, part 2]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tor Q} \impliedby \lnot P \tand \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item I told you
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I didn't go to the park, and
          \item I didn't go to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}
      \item If you can prove
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item I went to the park, or
          \item I went to the grocery store
        \end{enumerate}

        then I lied to you.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

So, all and all, there are four laws there. One of them isn't true. Can you
figure out which one?

I'll insert a page break so you can think about it.

\newpage
\ss{Differences (continued)}

The answer is to try to prove each law. They can all be proved using very simple
logic.

Let's get going! Just for the hell of it, let's work in reverse order.

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's second law, part 1]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tor Q} \implies \lnot P \tand \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    \answergraph{another-theorem-gimped.png}

    Let's do the unfolding and what not. I did it in the last couple of proofs,
    so I won't bother explaining it here. Well, it would probably be quicker to
    just explain what I'm doing than to explain that explaining my actions would
    take longer than\dots gah, recursion!

    Anyway:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{
          \parens{P \tor Q}
          \implies \bot
        }
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{P \implies \bot}
          \tand
          \parens{Q \implies \bot}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Which, in silly 4\textsuperscript{th}-grader chalkboard form:

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal} & : & \parens{P \implies \bot} \tand \parens{Q \implies \bot} \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Well, this isn't all that hard.

    Since the goal is logical-and, we have to prove \xtb{both} branches.

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & P \implies \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    We can proceed from here, moving anything before the last $\implies$ symbol
    above the line (because we are proving the last thing assuming the previous
    things).

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        b & : & P \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Well, if you'll remember, a proof of $P$ is a valid proof of $P \lor
    Q$. Therefore:

    \begin{rclmath}
        a & : & \parens{P \tor Q} \implies \bot \\
        b & : & P \\
        \eva{a}{\eva{\branchleft}{b}} & : & \bot \\
        \hline \\
        \text{goal}_\branchleft & : & \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's first law, part 2]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \impliedby \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    \begin{proof}
        Let's do the same thing, expand the definition of $\lnot$, as well as
        destruct logical-and:

        \begin{equation}
            \parens{
                \parens{P \implies \bot}
                \tor
                \parens{Q \implies \bot}
            }
            \implies
            \parens{
                P \implies Q \implies \bot
            }
        \end{equation}

        Remember the rule with the parentheses, where we can remove tailing pairs:

        \begin{equation}
            \parens{
                \parens{P \implies \bot}
                \tor
                \parens{Q \implies \bot}
            }
            \implies P \implies Q \implies \bot
        \end{equation}

        Let's do the whole thing from before with above-the-line and below-the-line.

        \begin{alignmath}{rcl}
            a & : & \parens{P \implies \bot} \tor \parens{Q \implies \bot} \\
            b & : & P \\
            c & : & Q \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{alignmath}

        Here, we have to look at both branches of $a$, and prove the theorem for
        both of them. We know that at least one of them has a proof, but we still
        have to consider the cases where one branch has a proof, but the other might
        not.

        Let's first look at the left branch:

        \begin{alignmath}{rcl}
            a_{\branchleft} & : & P \implies \bot \\
            b & : & P \\
            c & : & Q \\
            \eva{a_{\branchleft}}{b} & : & \bot \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{alignmath}

        Yay! And now the right branch:

        \begin{alignmath}{rcl}
            a_{\branchright} & : & Q \implies \bot \\
            b & : & P \\
            c & : & Q \\
            \eva{a_{\branchright}}{c} & : & \bot \\
            \hline \\
            \text{goal} & : & \bot \\
        \end{alignmath}

        Yay! Proof complete!
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[De Morgan's first law, part 1]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot\parens{P \tand Q} \implies \lnot P \tor \lnot Q
    \end{equation}

    Well, let's expand the definition of $\lnot$, shall we?
    \begin{equation}
        \parens{
          \parens{P \tand Q}
          \implies
          \bot
        }
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{P \implies \bot}
          \tor
          \parens{Q \implies \bot}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Well, the and-part can be destructed as such:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{
            P \implies Q \implies \bot
        }
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{P \implies \bot}
          \tor
          \parens{Q \implies \bot}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Hmm. This one looks tough. Let's come back to it
\end{theorem}
