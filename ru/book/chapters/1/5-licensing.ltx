\s{Licensing}

This book is libre.\footnote{\xti{Libre} is a French word, which,
translated to English, means \xti{free} in the sense of liberty, as
opposed to price. Think \xti{free speech}, not \xti{free beer}.} You can
copy this book and give it to your friend. You can even print it out and
sell it to people.\footnote{There are some restrictions though, see
\cref{gfdl}.}

If, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and want to use this for your
class, you are free to edit it to your liking and give the modified copy
to your students. The only string I attach is, you have to allow anyone
to whom you give the book do the same thing (i.e. they have to be free
to copy/modify/change your version). The details of this can be found in
\cref{gfdl}.

LYSA is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License. \Cref{gfdl}
contains the license. Please read the license; it's actually pretty
comprehensible.
